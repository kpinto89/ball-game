# ball-game

Here's a basic Java game where the player moves a green circle using arrow keys to collide with a red square target. The score increases when the player reaches the target, and the target moves to a new random position. Let me know if you'd like to add features like obstacles, levels, or a timer!

Obstacles: 
Blue rectangles are added as obstacles. Colliding with them ends the game.
Levels: 
The level increases every 5 points, and with each level, the player speed increases, and more obstacles are added.
Timer: 
The game includes a countdown timer (starting at 30 seconds). The game ends when the timer reaches zero.
